# Create or update a public IP address&#160;
## Request  
 See [Common parameters and headers](public-ip-addresses.md#bk_common) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to public IP addresses.  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|PUT|`/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/{public-IP-address-name}?api-version={api-version}`|  
  
 Replace {public-IP-address-name} with the name of the public IP address which you want to create or update.  
  
```json  
{  
   "location": "North US",  
   "tags": { "key": "value" },  
   "properties": {  
      "publicIPAllocationMethod": "Static",  
      "publicIPAddressVersion": "IPv4",  
      "idleTimeoutInMinutes": 4,  
      "dnsSettings": {  
         "domainNameLabel": "mylabel",  
         "reverseFqdn": "contoso.com."  
      }  
   }  
}  
```  
  
|Element name|Required|Type|Description|  
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|  
|location|Yes|String|Specifies the supported Azure location of the Public IP Address. For more information, see List all of the available geo-locations|  
|tags|No|Complex Type|The tags and their values that are used by the Public IP Address.|  
|publicIPAllocationMethod|Yes|String|Defines whether the IP address is stable or dynamic. Options are Static or Dynamic|  
|publicIPAddressVersion|No|String|Available from Api-Version 2016-03-30 onwards, it represents whether the specific publicIP address is IPv4 or IPv6. Default is taken as IPv4. Options are IPv4 or IPv6|  
|idleTimeoutInMinutes|No|Number|Specifies the timeout for the TCP idle connection. The value can be set between 4 and 30 minutes|  
|domainNameLabel|No|String|The concatenation of the domain name label and the regionalized DNS zone make up the fully qualified domain name associated with the public IP address. If a domain name label is specified, an A DNS record is created for the public IP in the Microsoft Azure DNS system.|  
|reverseFqdn|No|String|A fully qualified domain name that resolves to this public IP address. If the reverseFqdn is specified, then a PTR DNS record is created pointing from the IP address in the in-addr.arpa domain to the reverse FQDN.|
